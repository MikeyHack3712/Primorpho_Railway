## Gmail App Password Setup

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Navigate to "Security"
3. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. In Google Account settings for mikeelie.me@gmail.com, go to "Security"
2. Under "2-Step Verification", click "App passwords"
3. Select "Mail" as the app
4. Select "Other" as the device and name it "Crafted Sites Website"
5. Copy the 16-character app password (looks like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop)

### Step 3: Add to Replit Secrets
1. In your Replit project, go to the Secrets tab (lock icon in sidebar)
2. Add these secrets:
   - `GMAIL_USER`: your-email@gmail.com
   - `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`: the 16-character password from step 2
   - `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`: your-email@gmail.com (where you want notifications)

## What You'll Receive

When a client reserves a slot, you'll get an email with:
- Client contact information (name, email, phone, business)
- Service package selected (LaunchPad, Pro Presence, Smart Business)
- Project timeline and description
- Slot timing (January Early/Mid/Late)
- Direct links to email or call the client
- Link to your admin dashboard

## Testing

After setup, test by:
1. Going to your website
2. Reserving a test slot
3. Check your email for the notification

## Troubleshooting

**Email not sending?**
- Verify app password is correct (16 characters, no spaces)
- Check that 2FA is enabled on your Gmail account
- Ensure GMAIL_USER matches the account that generated the app password

**Wrong email address?**
- Update NOTIFICATION_EMAIL to your preferred email
- Can be different from GMAIL_USER if you want notifications elsewhere
