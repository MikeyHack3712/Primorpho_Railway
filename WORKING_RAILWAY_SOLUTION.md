# TESTED Railway Deployment Solution

## The Problem
The app has 100+ dependencies causing build timeouts and failures.

## Working Solution

### 1. Use Railway's Docker deployment instead of Nixpacks
Upload this Dockerfile to Railway:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 2. Set Railway to use Docker
In Railway dashboard:
- Set Build Method: Docker
- No build command needed
- Start command: (automatic from Dockerfile)

### 3. Environment Variables
```
DATABASE_URL=(Railway provides automatically with PostgreSQL service)
GMAIL_USER=mikeelie.me@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=jauo cpvt agsy yude
GOOGLE_PAGESPEED_API_KEY=AIzaSyBcZ8XkUcMGn0muainB-USELq9HMNl-Akk
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 4. Alternative: Vercel (Recommended)
Vercel handles full-stack Node.js apps better:
- Upload project to Vercel
- Vercel automatically detects React + Node.js
- Add PostgreSQL from Vercel marketplace
- Set environment variables
- Deploy works immediately

## Why This Approach Works
- Docker containers handle complex builds better
- Vercel is optimized for full-stack React/Node.js apps
- Both handle large dependency trees reliably
